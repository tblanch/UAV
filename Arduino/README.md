# Arduino
## This directory will contain all source code related to our ground vehicle running a Arduino for navigation and any other tasking required for mission completion.

## TODO:
* Add starter code for basic Arduino breakdown / implementation
* Research how to integrate this code into an Arduino board itself (how to load and execute it)
* Implement testing files and proper sub directories for testing, logging etc.
