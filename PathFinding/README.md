# Path Finding

## Directory Structure:
* ./:
  * Waypoint.py - File implements functionality for manipulating one waypoint
  * WaypointOut.py - File ties waypoint functionality for main testing
  * WaypointParser.py - File implements parsing functionality for judge given .kml files
* Testing:
  * TestWaypoint.py - Testing implemented for Waypoint.py
* Logs:
  * Log files containing information regarding previous runs

## TODO:
* Cross check output with expected output for competition
* Implement sub directories for waypoint manipulation and actual GPS real-time calculations
* Develop simple initial algorithm for making real time corrections of way points in accordance to obstacles
